# How to improve Haskell documentation

## The Haskell Wiki

### Outdated information

The simplest thing to do with outdated information on the [Haskell
Wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/) is to prominently mark it as such.
You can do so by adding a paragraph like

```html
<span style="color: red">[WARNING: This page is ''extremely'' outdated
and hasn't been updated since XXXX.  You should look at
[https://external/link/ External Link Text]
instead.]</span>
```

On the other hand, if you know how to bring the outdated information
up-to-date then please do so.  A third alternative is to delete
outdated information entirely, if you think that doing so will be
uncontroversial.
